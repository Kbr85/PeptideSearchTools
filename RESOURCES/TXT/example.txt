---> Brief Description of Peptide Search Tools 1.1.0 <---


Peptide Search Tools v1.1.0 is designed as a Notebook in which each tab gives 
access to specific functionalities. The main objective is to search for peptide
sequences in different files with various search criteria.


---> Description of individual tabs <---




#### The Consensus Tab ####


This tab allows to search a multifasta file for a given set of consensus
sequences. The set of consensus sequences can be searched for in a given set of
residue numbers or in the whole sequence of the proteins. Read below for more 
details. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The Tab assumes that the multifasta file follows the UNIPROT format for 
	the header of fasta files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All fields in the tab must be filled before starting the analysis.

- The Fasta File button allows to browse the file system to select a fasta 
	formated file containing multiple protein sequences. Only files with txt or 
	fasta extension can be selected.
- The Output File button allows to browse the file system to select the Output 
	file. Only files with txt extension can be selected.
- The Positions & AAs button allows to specify the positions and the amino acids
	in the consensus sequence. This field is not meant to be filled by hand.
	To input the values use the Positions & AAs.
- The Only complete proteins checkbox allows to select whether to consider all
	sequences in the multifasta file (unchecked state) or only the sequences of
	complete proteins (checked state).

The Poistions & AAs button opens a new window where the amino acids in the 
consensus sequences and the residue numbers can be specified. The use of the 
window is straightforward. Type the total number of residues in the consensus 
sequences and then press the button Create fields. The appropiate number of 
fields for the Residue numbers and AAs in the consensus sequences will be 
created. 

The expected input in each Residue number fields is the residue number of the 
protein sequence in which to look for the corresponding amino acid in the 
consensus sequences. Thus, an integer greater than cero is the expected input in
these fields. The residue numbers do not have to be consecutive but they are 
expected to be unique and monotonically increasing. Alternative, all residue 
number fields can be set to NA. In this case, the search for the consensus 
sequence is performed along the entire sequence of the proteins in the fasta 
file, but the consensus sequence is assumed to appear with no gaps in the 
protein sequences. The expected input in the fields Amino acids is a 
space-separated list of amino acids (one letter code). In each field, values
must be unique.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Right clicking the Residue numbers label will set all Residue number fields
	to NA.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special care must be taken with incomplete sequences when dealing with a 
multifasta file automatically generated. The UniProt convention is to mark these
sequences with the word Fragment in the header section and the presence or 
absence of this word is what it is used to exclude incomplete sequences from the
analysis. If all proteins are to be included in the analysis it is important to 
be aware that for incomplete sequences:
- there is no way to know the actual residue numbers
- there is no way to know if there are gaps between adjacent residues in the 
  sequence

Therefore, including incomplete sequences in the analysis should be done only in
very specific situations, e.g. manually curated multifasta file.  

The Output file will be a plain text file with two sections. The first section 
(Input Data) will list the given search options. The second section contains the
Output data.	

The information in the Output data section includes the total number of proteins
in the multifasta file, the total number of complete proteins, the total number 
of fragment proteins and the total number of proteins in which the consensus
sequence was found.

The last part of the section shows a detailed information about each sequence
in the consensus set including the number of proteins in which the sequence was
found and the protein IDs. The number of proteins in which the sequence was 
found is given as an absolute number and also as percent with respect to the 
total or complete protein numbers if fragments are included or excluded from the
analysis.

If the search is performed in the entire sequence of the proteins in the fasta 
file then, more than one consensus sequence can be found in a given protein.
Therefore, a list of Proteins IDs and consensus sequences identified for each
protein is also given in the output.


#### The Genes.fasta Tab ####


This tab allows to extract the N-terminal sequences, up to a user-defined 
length, of all proteins present in a multisequence fasta formated file that 
are encoded by a list of user-defined genes. 

All fields in the tab must be filled before starting the analysis.

- The Fasta File button allows to browse the file system to select a fasta 
	formated file containing multiple protein sequences. Only files with txt or 
	fasta extension can be selected.
- The Genes File button allows to browse the file system to select a plain text 
	file containing a list of genes. Only files with txt extension can be 
	selected. This file must contain a gene or a semicolon-separated 
	(;) list of genes in each line, for example:

	NME6
	TRIM17
	KLC2;PRKN
	POTEJ
	P3H3

- The Output File button allows to browse the file system to select the Output 
	file. Only files with txt extension can be selected.
- The Residues to Extract field allows to a specify the length of the N-terminal 
	peptides that will be extracted. Only a list of unique integers greater than
	cero can be accepted here, e.g. 5 10 25 50 100.

The Output file will be a plain text file with two sections. The first section 
(Input Data) will list the given search options. The second section contains the
output data.

The first row of the output section will have the name of the columns and the 
rest of the rows will be the identified proteins belonging to the given genes
with the peptide sequences. The output is sorted by gene name.


#### The Peptide.txt Tab ####


This tab allows to extract all N-terminal peptides found in a Maxquant 
peptide.txt file. In general, any file with tab separated columns and column 
names in the first row can be correctly searched. 

All fields in the tab must be filled before starting the search. 

- The Data File button allows to browse the file system to select the input 
	file. Only files with txt extension can be selected. Once the file is 
	selected the name and number of the columns in the file will be shown in the
	right section of the tab.
- The Output File button allows to browse the file system to select the output 
	file. Only files with txt extension can be selected.
- The field First Residue <= allows to specify a residue number. Peptides for 
	which the residue number of the first residue is lower or equal to the 
	specified number will be extracted from the Data File and saved in the 
	Output File. Only an integer greater than zero can be accepted here.
- The field Start Residue allows to specify the column in the Data File with
	the residue number of the first residue of the detected sequences. Only an 
	integer greater or equal than zero can be accepted here.
- The field Columns to Extract allows to specify the columns in the Data File 
	that will be extracted. Only a list of integers greater or equal than
	zero can be accepted here, e.g. 0 1 2 6 34 50.

The Output file will be a plain text file with a format similar to the given 
Data file. Only the specified Columns to Extract will be included in the 
Output file and columns will be tab separated. The file will have two section.
The first section (Input Data) will list the given search options. The second 
section contains the output data.

The first row in the Output Data section will have the name of the extracted 
columns. The other rows will contain sequences from the Data file for which the 
residue number of the first residue is equal or lower than the specified First 
Residue <= value.
