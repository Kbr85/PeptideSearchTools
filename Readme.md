# Petide Search Tools

The main objective of Peptide Search Tools is to search for peptide sequences 
in different files with various search criteria. The program is designed as a Notebook in which each tab gives access to specific functionalities. It is 
written in Python (3.8.5) and uses wxPython (4.1.0) to create the GUI.

## Installation

The program is distributed as ready to use binaries reducing the installation 
process to just [downloading]('https://github.com/Kbr85/PeptideSearchTools/releases') the files and double clicking on the executable.
